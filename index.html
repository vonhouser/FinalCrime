    <h1 class="text-align center">How do Large U.S. Cities Compare on Violent Crime Rates?</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">In 1992, the United States experienced the highest crime rate ever recorded, with both property crime and violent crime climbing steadily from the 1970's. After 1992, the crime rate began to drop, and continues to stay low. For the last two decade, pretty much everyone and every thing under the sun has been given (or taken) credit. From the 1994 Crime Act, to mayorial prowess of every major city, to mandatory minimum sentancing, everyone thinks their policies are what caused the drop. As is usually the case with large-scale social phenomenon, it's complicated.  </p>

                <p><span><strong><span class="firstLetter">T</span></strong></span> he people who claimed that hiring more police officers and locking folks up would lower crime may have been partially right. As you can see from the chart above, the total number of sworn law enforcement officers began to climb in the late 1980s, along with the crime rate. The rate of imprisonment also climbed. In the early 1990s the United States reached a turning point. Both violent and property crime began to decrease. However as crime dropped, police hirings and prison rates continued to rise. In the early part of the 21st century, imprisonment rates leveled off and began to drop slightly as the recession made it too difficult for States in particular to continue to house the large population of prisoners. California is a notable example of changing policies designed to release prisoners and reduce costs. The number of police officers continus to rise, possibly as a result of homeland security policies post 9-11. </p>

        <p><span><strong><span class="firstLetter">A</span></strong></span>nother factor that influenced property crime rates was the development of new technologies that made it harder to steal cars. Around the time the crime wave peaked, car manufacturers started including starter kill and keyless entry devices to new cars, making it harder to steal them. By 1998, the Honda Accord, historically the most hotwired vehicle in America, came with starter kill as a standard accessory. By 2002, European cars were required to be equiped with starter kill, and while this was not the case in the United States, most new cars are sold with it, greatly impacting motor vehicle theft rates. And remember those carjackings that used to happen with regularity in the 1990s? Much harder now that cars lock automatically and everyone has a cell phone. More about that next... </p>

    <p class="text-left"><span><strong><span class="firstLetter">A</span></strong></span>final piece of pervasive technology that impacted property crimes was the presence of cell phones. While it is the case that cell phones themselves can be stolen, the fact that people on the street can take photographs of crimes taking place or call the police at any time impacted certain street crimes. By 2012, more people owned smart phones than regular phones, and more than 80% of people owned some kind of cell phone. The additional fact that many smart phones now come with tracking software may also reduce larceny.</p>
